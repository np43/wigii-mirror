 * This service provides the possibility to store and fetch data in the session

 * Modified by CWE on April 3rd 2014 to add the possibility to store data into 
 * a particular subspace of the session which is cleared each time the user navigates
 * into Wigii (changes module or namespace). This acts as a navigation cache.
 * Modified by CWE on March 04th 2015 to add the possibility to store data into a shared memory implemented as a database table.
