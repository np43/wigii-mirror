This folder contains some files that allows you to extract a Wigii database with the QlikView product in a quick and easy way. This stands as a Wigii - QlikView connector.
QlikView script extract from a Wigii database structure all the necessary data. The extraction is done in csv and in qvd

In order to use it you need to have a QlikView client installed (or a QlikView server).

Create a new QlikView document, hit CTRL+E to open the Script Editor, delete everything that Qlik puts by default. Then click on Insert->Scriptfiles and select the file "Wigii Base Script.txt", click Open.

At begining of the script there is a series of parameters you can change:
- General format settings
- ODBC connection name that you have setup on your computer or server (that must be done with the MSWindow ODBC Wizard)
- Database name
- Trashbin folder name filter
- Last update time to look when reloading

You can update the file Dico.xls to translate fields of type Attributs or MultipleAttributs or fieldnames.
You can update the file Filters.xls if you don't want that the script extract all the Namespaces and modules contained within your Wigii database. The tab sys_fields is there to define what are the fields where you want to have the sys info extracted (i.e. first_name sys_date, first_name sys_creationDate, etc...)
